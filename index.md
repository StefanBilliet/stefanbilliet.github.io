## Before we talk

I tend to think a lot about how I work, what I enjoy doing well, and where I am not a great fit.

Over the years, I have learned that these things matter just as much as skills or experience when working with others. They shape how decisions are made, how pressure shows up, and what people expect from each other.

What follows is a short description of how I approach my work, the things I care about, and the kinds of situations in which I usually do my best work.

It is not meant to be exhaustive or persuasive.  
It is simply an honest snapshot.

## TL;DR

- I rely on technical excellence, simplicity of design, and pragmatic scoping to achieve consistent delivery of value.
- I take responsibility for the structural soundness of the systems I work on, and I try to avoid choices that knowingly undermine that.
- I am most effective in setups where architectural responsibility and decision-making authority are clearly aligned.
- I usually question trade-offs that are described as temporary when their effects are likely to be long-lasting.
- I value collaboration, but I also have clear views on fundamentals and will voice them when they matter.

## How I think about software

I see software as a long-lived system, not a sequence of features.

Most problems I encounter in teams are not caused by a lack of effort or talent, but by:

- unclear boundaries
- implicit decisions
- short-term incentives overriding structural concerns

I believe:

- quality is not a luxury, it is a force multiplier over time
- speed and quality are not opposing sliders in the long run
- complexity does not disappear when ignored, it accumulates

I am comfortable making trade-offs, but only when they are:

- explicit
- owned
- acknowledged as real costs

I strongly embrace pragmatism in scope, because that is where leverage exists to deliver meaningful value with minimal effort.  
I am much more cautious with technical “pragmatism”, except when deliberately working on prototypes.

## How I work day to day

- I prefer working things out together rather than relying on long written analyses. I think best in conversation, by exploring options and constraints collaboratively.
- I value alignment that leads to clear decisions, more than alignment that remains implicit or open-ended.
- I tend to frame problems in terms of boundaries, responsibilities, and invariants, especially when things start to feel unclear or fragile.
- I am willing to pause early when structure or ownership is ambiguous, because unresolved ambiguity tends to slow teams down later.

I am usually calm in discussion, but persistent when I believe a structural issue is being glossed over.

## What will frustrate me

This is not a list of pet peeves.  
It describes situations where responsibility, incentives, and consequences fall out of alignment.

I tend to get frustrated when:

- I am held responsible for outcomes without the authority to influence them
- calls for “pragmatism” focus on technical shortcuts without naming what is being traded away
- architectural decisions are treated as temporary when no one is realistically willing to revisit them
- changes are pushed through as “experiments” in ways that discourage meaningful pushback
- metrics are used as blunt proxies rather than as signals
- quality is framed as a personal preference instead of a property of the system

When these patterns appear in isolation, they are usually manageable.  
When they become systemic, they make it hard to reason clearly about decisions and their consequences.

---

## What you can expect from me

- I surface risks early, even when doing so is inconvenient.
- I take ownership for the systems I work on, and I am deliberate about the responsibilities that come with it.
- I invest in making systems easier to reason about, especially as they grow and change.
- I support teammates who want to understand why things work the way they do, not just what to do next.

I am reliable, but not passive.  
When something feels structurally wrong, I will say so.

---

## The kind of environment I thrive in

I do best in environments where:

- long-term consequences are part of decision-making
- technical judgment is trusted, rather than constantly negotiated
- disagreement is possible without being personalized
- quality is treated as an investment, not as a tax

I am a poor fit for environments where:

- short-term speed is optimized at all costs
- responsibility is deliberately diffuse
- “we will fix it later” is the default strategy

---

## Working remotely

I generally prefer remote or hybrid setups, with a strong emphasis on working from home.

Based on experience, I do not consider physical presence a prerequisite for effective collaboration, trust, or team bonding. I am comfortable building alignment, having difficult conversations, and doing deep technical work in a remote-first context.

That said, I am not opposed to in-person moments when they serve a clear purpose. What matters to me is intention, not proximity.

## Final note

This reflects how I currently think about my work, based on what I’ve learned so far.  
It’s best understood as a starting point for a conversation.
