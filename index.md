## My operating manual

I tend to think a lot about how I work, what I enjoy doing well, and where I am not a great fit.

Over the years, I have learned that these things matter just as much as skills or experience when working with others. They shape how decisions are made, how pressure shows up, and what people expect from each other.

What follows is a short description of how I approach my work, the things I care about, and the kinds of situations in which I usually do my best work.

It is not meant to be exhaustive or persuasive.  
It is simply an honest snapshot.

## TL;DR

- I rely on technical excellence, simplicity of design, and pragmatic scoping to achieve consistent delivery of value over time.  
- I take responsibility for the long-term health of the systems I work on, and I try to avoid choices that introduce long-term system risk without being explicit about the trade-offs involved.  
- I am most effective in setups where architectural responsibility and decision-making authority are clearly aligned.  
- I usually question trade-offs that are described as temporary when their long-term impact is likely to outlive the context that justified them.  
- I value collaboration, but I also have clear views on fundamentals and will voice them when they matter.

## How I think about software

I see software as a long-lived system, not just a sequence of features.

Most problems I encounter in teams are not caused by a lack of effort or talent, but by:

- unclear boundaries
- implicit decisions
- short-term incentives overriding structural concerns

I tend to think of the following as generally true in complex systems:

- quality is not a luxury; it reduces system friction immediately and compounds into a force multiplier over time
- speed and quality are not opposing sliders
- complexity does not disappear when ignored; it accumulates

I am comfortable making trade-offs, but only when they are:

- explicit
- owned
- acknowledged as real costs

I strongly embrace pragmatism in scope, because that is where leverage often exists to deliver meaningful value with minimal effort.  
I am more cautious with technical “pragmatism”, except when deliberately working on prototypes.

## How I work day to day

- I prefer working things out together rather than relying solely on long written analyses. I tend to think best in conversation, by collaboratively exploring options and constraints.
- I value alignment that leads to clear decisions, more than alignment that remains implicit or open-ended.
- I tend to frame problems in terms of boundaries, responsibilities, and invariants, especially when things start to feel unclear or fragile.
- I am willing to pause early when structure or ownership is ambiguous, because unresolved ambiguity often slows teams down later.

I am usually calm in discussion, but persistent when I believe a structural issue may be being glossed over.

## Where I am least effective

This is not a list of pet peeves.  
It describes situations where responsibility, incentives, and consequences fall out of alignment.

These are patterns that tend to create systemic risk, and over time make it difficult to reason clearly about decisions and outcomes.

I tend to find it difficult to work effectively when:

- I am held responsible for outcomes without the authority to meaningfully influence them
- calls for “pragmatism” focus on technical shortcuts without making the trade-offs and long-term costs explicit
- architectural decisions are treated as temporary when no one is realistically willing to revisit them
- changes are pushed through as “experiments” in ways that discourage meaningful technical pushback
- metrics are used as blunt proxies rather than as signals to inform decision-making
- quality is framed as a personal preference instead of as a property of the system

None of these are unusual in isolation.  
What matters to me is whether teams are willing and able to look at these patterns systemically and improve them over time.

## What you can expect from me

- I surface risks early, even when doing so is inconvenient in the short term.
- I take ownership of the systems I work on, and I am deliberate about the responsibilities that come with that ownership.
- I invest in making systems easier to reason about, especially as they grow and change.
- I support teammates who want to understand why things work the way they do, not just what to do next.

I am reliable, but not passive.  
If something appears structurally wrong, I will say so.

## The kind of environment I thrive in

I do best in environments where:

- long-term consequences are part of decision-making
- technical judgment is trusted, rather than constantly renegotiated
- disagreement is possible without being personalized
- quality is treated as an investment, not as a tax

I tend to be less effective in environments where:

- short-term speed consistently takes precedence over long-term system health
- responsibility is deliberately diffuse
- “we will fix it later” becomes the default strategy rather than an exception

## Working remotely

I generally prefer remote or hybrid setups, with a strong emphasis on working from home.

Based on experience, I do not see physical presence as a prerequisite for effective collaboration, trust, or team bonding. I am comfortable building alignment, having difficult conversations, and doing deep technical work in a remote-first context.

That said, I am not opposed to in-person moments when they serve a clear purpose. What matters to me is intention, not proximity.

## Final note

This reflects how I currently think about my work, based on what I’ve learned so far.  
It is best understood as a starting point for a conversation.
