# My operating manual

I tend to think a lot about how I work, what I enjoy doing well, and where I am not a great fit.

Over time, I’ve learned that these things matter just as much as skills or experience when working with others. They shape how decisions are made, how pressure shows up, and what people expect from each other.

I care a lot about building systems — and ways of working — that teams can rely on, especially when things get complex or stressful.

What follows is a summary of patterns that have helped me and the teams I work with deliver sustainably over time.  
It’s best understood as context for how I operate, not as a checklist.

## TL;DR

- I rely on strong engineering fundamentals, simplicity of design, and pragmatic scoping to deliver value consistently over time.  
- I take responsibility for the long-term health of the systems I work on, and I try to avoid introducing long-term system risk without making trade-offs explicit.  
- I am most effective in setups where architectural responsibility and decision-making authority are clearly aligned.  
- I usually question trade-offs that are described as temporary when their long-term impact is likely to outlive the context that justified them.  
- I value collaboration, shared ownership of decisions, and environments where disagreement can happen without becoming personal.  
- I have clear views on fundamentals and will voice them when they matter, especially when I believe it protects delivery, quality, or team sustainability.

## How I think about software

I see software as a long-lived system, not just a sequence of features.

Most problems I encounter in teams are not caused by a lack of effort or talent, but by:

- unclear boundaries  
- implicit decisions  
- short-term incentives overriding structural concerns  

In complex systems, I generally assume the following patterns hold:

- quality is not a luxury — it reduces system friction immediately and compounds over time  
- speed and quality are not opposing sliders  
- complexity does not disappear when ignored; it accumulates  

I am comfortable making trade-offs, but only when they are:

- explicit  
- owned  
- acknowledged as real costs  

I strongly embrace pragmatism in scope, because that is often where the highest leverage exists.  
I am more cautious with technical “pragmatism”, except when deliberately working on prototypes.

My goal here is not technical purity, but rather predictable delivery, lower long-term cost, and systems teams can safely evolve over time.

I generally assume good intent in teams and decisions, even when I disagree with the direction.  
When I push on structural concerns, it usually comes from wanting the system — and the people working in it — to succeed long term.

## How I work day to day

- I prefer working things out together rather than relying solely on long written analyses. I tend to think best in conversation, by collaboratively exploring options and constraints.  
- I value alignment that leads to clear decisions more than alignment that remains implicit or open-ended.  
- I tend to frame problems in terms of boundaries, responsibilities, and invariants, especially when things start to feel unclear or fragile.  
- I am willing to pause early when structure or ownership is ambiguous, because unresolved ambiguity usually slows teams down later.  

I am usually calm in discussion, but persistent when I believe a structural issue may be getting glossed over.

---

## The kind of environment I thrive in

I do best in environments where:

- long-term consequences are part of decision-making  
- technical judgment is trusted, rather than constantly renegotiated  
- disagreement is possible without being personalized  
- quality is treated as an investment, not as a tax  
- trade-offs are visible and owned, even when they are uncomfortable

## Where I tend to be less effective

I tend to do my best work in environments where responsibility, authority, and long-term consequences are clearly connected.

I usually struggle when these drift apart — for example when ownership is unclear, when structural trade-offs remain implicit, or when short-term decisions repeatedly override long-term system health without being acknowledged as trade-offs.

None of these situations are unusual in isolation.  
What matters is whether teams are willing and able to make these patterns visible and improve them over time.

## What you can expect from me

- I surface risks early, even when doing so is inconvenient in the short term.  
- I take ownership of the systems I work on, and I am deliberate about the responsibilities that come with that ownership.  
- I invest in making systems easier to reason about, especially as they grow and change.  
- I support teammates who want to understand why things work the way they do, not just what to do next.  

I am reliable, but not passive.  
If something appears structurally wrong, I will say so — usually calmly, and usually with the goal of preventing bigger problems later.

## Working remotely

I generally prefer remote or hybrid setups, with a strong emphasis on working from home.

In my experience, effective collaboration, trust, and team bonding can be built in remote-first environments. I am comfortable building alignment, having difficult conversations, and doing deep technical work in that context.

I am not opposed to in-person moments when they serve a clear purpose.  
What matters to me is intention, not proximity.

## Final note

This reflects how I currently think about my work, based on what I’ve learned so far.  
It will likely keep evolving.

It is best understood as a starting point for a conversation.
